# The BPM Meta Model

Today, business process management determines the modern business world. Business Processes are the foundation to achieve the business goals of digitization, collaboration  and optimizing technical processes within an organization.
But unfortunately it often happens that we get stuck or even fail when we try to describe a business process. Most of the time, as we've found, this is because we're not asking the right questions. 


The BPM Meta Model is a tool that helps you to develop your business processes faster and more resilient. It does not matter which modeling standard or which workflow engine you use. The model is universally applicable - both to the design of general business processes and the technical modeling of fine grained business rules. 



For each phase of business process modeling, you should find answers to the following five questions. 


## 1.) Why do you need it?

*This is the most overlooked question when starting modeling. The question is why do you need the process? Why do problems arise here and why is there no solution for them so far? This question forms the context for the further procedure.*

## 2.) What is the main Task?

*What is the main task of that process? This should have one clear answer that is understandable to every actor involved in the process. If you can find multiple answers to this question, then it is time to start refining your modeling.*

## 3.) Who is responsible?
 
*Each process is executed by actors. These can be people within an organisation but also a technical service. The actors are solely responsible for the correct processing of the task. If you find more than one actor or role involved into the task, think about refining your process.*

## 4.) What if it doesn't work?

*What should happen when the processing of the task fails? How do you deal with exceptions? How can you compensate a task that has already started? This question is not only important for technical systems, but also for the implementation of human centric business processes.*

## 5.) What's next?

*This question is closing the task by opening the next one. A process is always a cycle that entails further processing. So thinking about this question helps you to see the process holistically.*
